abstract = "Sensorized commercial buildings are a rich target for building a new class of applications that improve operational and energy efficiency of building operations that take into account human activities. Such applications, however, rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema that would enable porting these applications and systems to different buildings. Our demo presents Brick [4], a uniform schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable applications. Using a web application, we will demonstrate real buildings that have been mapped to the Brick schema, and show application queries that extracts relevant metadata from these buildings. The attendees would be able to create example buildings and write their own queries."
