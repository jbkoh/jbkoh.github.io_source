abstract = "This short document introduces a proposal for the schema.org community to begin work in the "Internet of Things" (IoT) area, building on schema.org's existing success to provide an approach to semantic interoperability that bridges IoT and non-IoT applications. It outlines some possible application areas where schema.org-oriented structured data vocabularies may be useful, gives some examples of related schemas and related standards efforts, before proposing some practical steps for collaborative work."
